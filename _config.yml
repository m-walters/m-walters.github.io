  A 90's child from Stratford, Ontario.
  Always loved math, science, and music, with more recent affairs of interest in computer science, machine learning, and AI at large.  
  <br/>
  Academically, I am in the final leg of a MSc. Physics at the University of Waterloo, where 
  my research lies at the intersection of machine learning
  and condensed matter. More details can be found below.  
  <br/>
  In work placements, I joined [Hyper-K's](http://www.hyperk.org/) neutrino detecting efforts at 
  Canada's leading accelerator lab, [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca), researched astrophysics 
  at McMaster University, and developed software at Canada's Communications Security Establishment.  
  <br/>
  Outside academia, I've dabbled in polymer clay and wood working, music writing, 
  masochistically running Linux, and killing any plant I try to grow.  
  <br/> 
  My strongest software skills are: __Python, C++, Bash, MATLAB, $$\LaTeX$$, Git__ (mostly private repos)  
  <br/>
  I also make a *mean* frozen pizza.
