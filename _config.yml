  A 90's baby from modest Stratford, Ontario.  
  Always loved math, science, music, with more recent affairs in computer science, macine learning, and AI at large.  
  <br/>
  Academically, I am in the final leg of a MSc. Physics at the University of Waterloo, where 
  my research lies at the intersection of machine learning
  and condensed matter. More details can be found below.  
  <br/>
  In work placements, I joined [Hyper-K's](http://www.hyperk.org/) neutrino detecting efforts at 
  Canada's leading accelerator lab, [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca), researched astrophysics 
  at McMaster University, and developed software at the Canada's Communications Security Establishment.  
  <br/>
  Non-academically, I've dabbled in claywork, woodworking, music writing, and killing any plant I try to grow.  
  I also make a *mean* frozen pizza.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
