  A 90's kid from Stratford, Ontario.
  Always loved math, science, and music, with more recent affairs of interest in computer science, machine learning, and AI at large. I'm also interested in channeling my efforts towards a renewable energy future.  
  <br/>
  Academically, I recently finished my MSc. Physics at the University of Waterloo, where 
  my research sat at the intersection of machine learning
  and condensed matter. More details can be found below.  
  <br/>
  In work placements, I joined the [Hyper-K](http://www.hyperk.org/) 
  neutrino detecting efforts&mdash;the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize winner 
  Super-K&mdash;at Canada's premier accelerator lab, 
  [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca), researched astrophysics 
  at McMaster University, and developed software at Canada's Communications Security Establishment.  
  <br/>
  Outside academia, I've dabbled in polymer clay and wood working, music writing, 
  and masochistically running Linux on my PC.  
  <br/> 
  My strongest software skills are: __Python, C++, Bash, Tensorflow, MATLAB, $$\LaTeX$$, Git__ (mostly private repos)  
  Frequently used Python libraries: __numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn__  
  I also have experience in: __Maple, SQL, Postgres, Geant4, ROOT__
