  Things that get me out of bed in the morning: Solving problems with math, science, and coding; Collaborating towards meaningful, impacting projects; Coffee.  
  <br/>
  Academically, my latest vocation was a MSc. Physics at the University of Waterloo, where 
  my research straddled the intersection of machine learning
  and condensed matter. Before that, was Hamilton, Ontario's McMaster University.  
  <br/>
  Most recently, I was as Senior Backend Developer at [QED](http://qed.software/), developing genericized platform tools and architecture
  for custom instantiation in business and data management contexts. [Since 2022](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/link-alliance_innovation-safety-cityraillink-activity-7057493881868750848-1pwn/?originalSubdomain=nz)
  QED has been creating custom software for New Zealand's 
  ["largest transport infrastructure project ever"](https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/#:~:text=Introducing%20the%20CRL&text=The%20%245.493%20billion%20project%20is,Station%20on%20the%20Western%20Line.).
  In other work placements, I joined the [Hyper-K](http://https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/hk/) 
  neutrino detecting efforts&mdash;the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize winner 
  Super-K&mdash;at Canada's premier accelerator lab, 
  [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca); researched galactic cloud astrophysics via simulation at McMaster University with [James Wadsley's group](https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~wadsley/); 
  and worked on an anomaly detection ML model at Canada's Communications Security Establishment.  
  <br/>
  Outside academic and professional pursuits, I love hosting and making food for friends and family; taking my Olympus OM-1 outdoors for some
  film shooting (though my bank account would prefer I don't); Volunteering at [The Local Community Food Centre](https://thelocalcfc.org); 
  and masochistically running Linux on my PC.  
  <br/> 
  My strongest software skills are: __Python, Django, Tensorflow, Bash, $$\LaTeX$$, Git, C++, MATLAB, R__
  Frequently used Python libraries: __numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn__  
  I also have experience in: __SQL, Postgres, Geant4, ROOT__
