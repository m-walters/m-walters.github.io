  Things that get me out of bed in the morning: Solving problems with math, science, and coding; Collaborating towards meaningful, impacting projects; Coffee.  
  <br/>
  Academically, my latest vocation was a MSc. Physics at the University of Waterloo, where 
  my research applied Supervised (FNN, RNN) and Unsupervised (PCA) machine learning methods to simulated liquid crystal systems for defect detection. 
  Before that, was Hamilton, Ontario's McMaster University.  
  <br/>
  Most recently, I was as Senior Backend Developer at [QED](http://qed.software/), developing genericized platform tools and architecture
  for custom instantiation in business and data management contexts. [Since 2022](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/link-alliance_innovation-safety-cityraillink-activity-7057493881868750848-1pwn/?originalSubdomain=nz)
  QED has been creating custom software for New Zealand's 
  ["largest transport infrastructure project ever"](https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/#:~:text=Introducing%20the%20CRL&text=The%20%245.493%20billion%20project%20is,Station%20on%20the%20Western%20Line.).
  In other work placements, I joined the [Hyper-K](http://https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/hk/) 
  neutrino detecting efforts&mdash;the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize winner 
  Super-K&mdash;at Canada's premier accelerator lab, 
  [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca); researched galactic cloud astrophysics via simulation at McMaster University with [James Wadsley's group](https://physics.mcmaster.ca/~wadsley/); 
  and worked on an anomaly detection ML model at Canada's Communications Security Establishment. I am also an extended volunteer for [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/).  
  <br/>
  Outside academic and professional pursuits, I love hosting and making food for friends and family; taking my Olympus OM-1 outdoors for some
  film shooting (though my bank account would prefer I don't); Volunteering at [The Local Community Food Centre](https://thelocalcfc.org); 
  and masochistically running Linux on my PC.  
  <br/>
  I also write weekly on AI/AI Safety papers on my substack, [Weekly Aligned](https://www.weeklyaligned.com).

  <br/>
  My strongest software skills are: __Python, Django, Tensorflow, Bash, $$\LaTeX$$, Git, C++, MATLAB, R__  
  Frequently used Python libraries: __numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, scikit-learn__  
  I also have experience in: __HTML, Vue, SQL, Postgres, Geant4, ROOT__
