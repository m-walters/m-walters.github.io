    _Better decision-making with AI risk estimation_  
    
    In my recent research, I've been putting into practice theory from Active Inference and Free-Energy-based
    learning directives, in collaboration with 
    [Rafael Kaufmann](https://rkauf.me/) and [Justice Sefas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YONbkq3uRGEpzZ-88Qhzz26p8kqE1toC/view).  
    
    We are demonstrating how ActInf formalisms can provide first-principle risk metrics to stakeholders, aiding to
    bridge inner and outer alignment between stakeholders and agent objective functions. 
    In one scenario we demonstrate how agent forecasting can signal population collapse in a fisheries context. 
    In another, we investigate how our risk metric can inform a gatekeeper module in autonomous vehicle decision-making.
    
    These experiments utilize probabilistic programming, generative modeling, and the `gymnasium` toolkit.
    Have a poke around the AV [repo](https://github.com/m-walters/av-agents).
    We aim to preprint our findings over the next few months, but here are some 
    [recent slides](https://slides.com/michaelwalters/gaia-network-lightweight-deck-ai-safety/scroll) and 
    [writing sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ryGAmk2wLHDbqtcw-WRqStKDXV43y-_NWhY2-0eGcsw/edit#heading=h.wklc2ntkjmh7).

    The [Supervised Program for Alignment Research](https://berkeleyaisafety.com/spar) (SPAR) program brings project leads and new researchers together
    to tackle questions at the forefront of AI safety and alignment. Through SPAR I joined three projects:
    
    With Rafael Kaufmann and Roman Leventov, our group is looking at how systems referencing a shared causal
    world-model can help us reason about, quantify and improve the safety of AI systems in their interactions 
    with real-world (physical and social) environments.

    With Kellin Pelrine, our group is looking into applying hybrid neural network architectures, including LLMs and 
    anomaly detection, to combat malicious coordinated group activities on social media.
    
    With Gabriel Mukobi, our group is investigating algorithms and benchmarks for Unadaptable Foundation Models. 
    If tenable, pretrained models that undergo unadaptability processing would be resistant to finetuning in certain directions, while ideally 
    maintaining the capacity for desirable finetuning directions.

    The small team size and startup nature of the company required learning and engaging with the numerous technological layers of the product, 
    from direct database tinkering to frontend UX, and all the surrounding programs/utilities. 
    This demands both breadth and depth of development to get the job done.  
    
    More technically, through Django and Postgres I had a significant hand in constructing a suite of genericized models, tools, and 
    architecture that could be instantiated and characterized swiftly yet specifically via YAML files for a given product context. 
    The result allows sophisticated customization of not only model properties but interactions across objects on a per customer basis. 
    This also included building out the REST API, automated testing suites for all corners of the codebase with GitHub Action workflows, and documentation. 
    I also built many other in-house, ad-hoc data management features and reports to grant customers insights into their data.  
    
    I worked to both design and code numerous aspects of the platform backend through its iterative growth over the past three years. 
    Other undertakings of note would include: managing a collaboration between a contracted third party to design a locomotive 
    worksite scheduling optimizer using machine learning; Prototyping an Internet-of-Things plug-in to our software; 
    Formulating a multivariate mathematical model for worksite Task Success/Health prediction.

    At the Communications Security Establishment of Canada I programmed a hybrid neural net for anomaly detection. The language was primarily Python,
    using TensorFlow with a Postgres database.

    I simulated galactic disk portions using parallel SPH tree-code Gasoline to investigate behavioural dependencies on certain factors, primarily resolution.
    I prepared various initial conditions for these runs, with subsequent analysis in Python.
    The HPC cluster SHARCNET was used for these runs.

    As part of the T2K Canada group, I worked on the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize-winning neutrino oscillation experiment Super-Kamiokande.
    My primary work was analyzing the timing resolution of three different flash analog-to-digital signal converter modules.
    This included acquiring and processing signal data, for which I used the CERN analysis toolkit ROOT. I also simulated neutrino oscillation
    detection events in the Water-Cherenkov detector, WCSim, using Geant4.
