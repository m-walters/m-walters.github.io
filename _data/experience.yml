    The small team size and startup nature of the company required learning and engaging with the numerous technological layers of the product, 
    from direct database tinkering to frontend UX, and all the surrounding programs/utilities. 
    This demands both breadth and depth of development to get the job done.  
    
    More technically, through Django and Postgres I had a significant hand in constructing a suite of genericized models, tools, and 
    architecture that could be instantiated and characterized swiftly yet specifically via YAML files for a given product context. 
    The result allows sophisticated customization of not only model properties but interactions across objects on a per customer basis. 
    This also included building out the REST API, automated testing suites for all corners of the codebase with GitHub Action workflows, and documentation. 
    I also built many other in-house, ad-hoc data management features and reports to grant customers insights into their data.  
    
    I worked to both design and code numerous aspects of the platform backend through its iterative growth over the past three years. 
    Other undertakings of note would include: managing a collaboration between a contracted third party to design a (train) 
    rail-worksite scheduling optimizer using machine learning; Prototyping an Internet-of-Things plug-in to our software; 
    Formulating a multivariate mathematical model for worksite Task Success/Health prediction.

    At the Communications Security Establishment of Canada I programmed a hybrid neural net for anomaly detection. The language was primarily Python,
    using TensorFlow with a Postgres database.

    I simulated galactic disk portions using parallel SPH tree-code Gasoline to investigate behavioural dependencies on certain factors, primarily resolution.
    I prepared various initial conditions for these runs, with subsequent analysis in Python.
    The HPC cluster SHARCNET was used for these runs.

    As part of the T2K Canada group, I worked on the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize-winning neutrino oscillation experiment Super-Kamiokande.
    My primary work was analyzing the timing resolution of three different flash analog-to-digital signal converter modules.
    This included acquiring and processing signal data, for which I used the CERN analysis toolkit ROOT. I also simulated neutrino oscillation
    detection events in the Water-Cherenkov detector, WCSim, using Geant4.
