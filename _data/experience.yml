    At the Communications Security Establishment of Canada I programmed a hybrid neural net for anomaly detection. The language was primarily Python,
    using TensorFlow with a Postgres database.

    I simulated galactic disk portions using parallel SPH tree-code Gasoline to investigate behavioural dependencies on certain factors, primarily resolution.
    I prepared various initial conditions for these runs, with subsequent analysis in Python.
    The HPC cluster SHARCNET was used for these runs.

    As part of the T2K Canada group, I worked on the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize-winning neutrino oscillation experiment Super-Kamiokande.
    My primary work was to determine the timing resolution of three different flash analog-to-digital signal converter modules.
    This included acquiring and processing signal data, for which I used the CERN analysis toolkit ROOT.
