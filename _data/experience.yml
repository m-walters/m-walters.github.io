    I simulated a galactic disk portion using parallel SPH tree-code Gasoline to investigate behavioural dependencies on certain factors, primarily resolution.
    I prepared and modified initial conditions for these runs, and wrote Python scripts for the subsequent analysis.
    The HPC cluster SHARCNET was used for these runs.

    As part of the T2K Canada group, I wokred on the successor to the 2015 Nobel Prize-winning neutrino oscillation project Super-Kamiokande.
    My primary work was to determine the timing resolution of three different flash analog-to-digital signal converter modules.
    This included acquiring and processing signal data, for which I used the CERN analysis toolkit ROOT.
