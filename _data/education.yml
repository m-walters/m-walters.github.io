    Thesis-based Master's under Prof. Jeff Chen researching the use and efficacy of neural networks in 
    learning phases of matter and topological defects, using a simulated liquid crystal system 
    as a testbed. Findings included the novel use of [Recurrent Neural Networks to learn topological features](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.062701?fbclid=IwAR0aaXGnTeYb_p7BAYYYKBftRkI0hv_m88w3ieR3-CnvLsaGrr0GnfhiAbo) in an off-lattice setting.
    Additional thesis research was done using [Principle Component Analysis on simulated localized defects](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/14949) to then identify their presence in
    large-scale liquid crystal arrangements.
    Coursework covered quantum mechanics, quantum many-body systems, Monte Carlo methods, and stochastic processes.
